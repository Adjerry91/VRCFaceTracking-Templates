Testversions and minor updates will be posted on the (WetHub)*Galaxy Lab Discord.

The Controller will be updated regularly on the Gumroad, whenever we got a couple of changes or important fixes.

In short:

Gumroad:
- always stable versions

Discord #locomotion-updates Channel:
- little updates
- testversions
- previews

You are allowed to use versions of the #locomotion-updates channel on "for sale" avatars.
If you are looking for maximum stability however, always go with the Gumroad versions.


if you are using the fix on a for sale model, always credit the gumroad.
