HELLO!

Hi,

since the normal controller got kinda big, we provide "LocomotionFIX_LITE" additionally.
Whats the difference?

LocomotionFix_LITE only provides locomotion and has no additional stuff integrated. It is designed to be "pure locomotion and nothing else", if you dont want to bother with anything.

PS:
"DisLocomotion" Parameter is there for FBT as well, either use it ingame or just check/uncheck it in the controller itself to walk or float ingame as you like.
