## Face Tracking Animation Tips:

* Modification to the thresholds may be needed for some animation sensitivity for different faces
*	:warning: There is bug on older version of the template that causes animator crashes, severe lag with the avatar to you and others. This is caused when there is many blend trees referencing the _Do_Nothing animation, the newest template v3.1.4 and higher .
